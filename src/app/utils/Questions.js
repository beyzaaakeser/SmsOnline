    title: 'Where are your numbers from?',
    desc: 'The majority of phone numbers originate from the real SIM cards, not from virtual or VoIP numbers. As a result, you will be able to verify almost any service, even those that do not accept virtual numbers, such as Google or Whatsapp. We work with partners who provide the numbers and maintain the real people who earn commissions from keeping these numbers active.',

    title: 'How long are the numbers active?',
    desc: "You usually have 20 minutes to verify your service after requesting a number. There are some cases where it may take 5-10 minutes. The verification will timeout if you don't receive a code in that time. The payment is canceled if no SMS message is received. You only pay for successful activations.",

    title: 'Can I use the same number again?',
    desc: 'No, we only offer one-time disposable numbers. You will no longer be able to access the number after receiving an SMS.',

    title: 'How the pricing works?',
    desc: 'The prices are determined by supply and demand using advanced machine learning algorithms. It may change even within a short period of time. The price is always per one successfully received SMS message.',
